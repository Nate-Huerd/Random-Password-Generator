# Random-Password-Generator

## Purpose
 *The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator using the criteria below:
 **8-128 characters
 **May include uppercase and lowercase letters
 **May include numbers and symbols
 
## Design
*This was primarily developed by utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
*The HTML and CSS code were provided to us, so we had to write the JavaScript code ourselves with little given starter code

##Result
*The password generator does not work quite yet. The code is there to initiate the prompts, but the password is not generated at the end. Further learning and code application will be needed to complete this challenge.
